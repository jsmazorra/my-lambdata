Both the "check_for_nulls" and "split_dates" from -my_mod appear to work (tested in Colab).

The my_script.py file appears to be irrelevant for package functions.

I would consider adding docstrings for both functions explaining what the variables are, and how the function manipulates them.

Maybe consider splitting your README.md description into Installation and Usage section so it's more intuitive to work with the package.

Functionally flawless, just requires some polishing on the documentation part.
